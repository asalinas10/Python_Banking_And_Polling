# Python Banking and Polling

In this challenge I wrote Python scripts to analyze banking data called PyBank, as well as polling data called PyPoll.

# Summary

PyBank:

In this script I used Python to analyze records to calculate the following values:

    - The total number of months included in the dataset

    - The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

    - The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

    - The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

    - The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

Data used for this can be found under budget_data.csv under the appropiate Resources folder.

PyPoll:

In this script I used Python to analyze records to calculate the following values:

    - The total number of votes cast

    - A complete list of candidates who received votes

    - The percentage of votes each candidate won

    - The total number of votes each candidate won

    - The winner of the election based on popular vote
